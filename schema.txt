Log Intelligence System for Incident Discovery & Anomaly Detection

Problem Statement 
Modern systems generate millions of logs daily. Most incidents are unknown beforehand, labels are missing, and rule-based alerts don’t scale.
This project builds an unsupervised system to automatically discover log patterns, detect anomalies, and surface novel incidents without prior labels.
